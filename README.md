# PRODIGY_FS_02


During my internship at Prodigy Infotech, I developed an Employee Management System focusing on CRUD operations using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project enhanced my skills in frontend development, including structuring with HTML, styling with CSS for a responsive layout, and implementing dynamic functionalities with JavaScript. Working alongside experienced developers, I learned industry best practices in web development, agile methodologies, and the importance of collaborative teamwork. This experience was pivotal in deepening my understanding of full-stack development and preparing me for real-world projects in the field.
